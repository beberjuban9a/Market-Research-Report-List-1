<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Heart Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Absorbable Heart Stent</li><li>Metal Absorbable Heart Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The absorbable heart stent market consists of two main types: polymer absorbable heart stents and metal absorbable heart stents. Polymer absorbable stents are designed to gradually dissolve over time, allowing for natural vessel healing while providing temporary support. In contrast, metal absorbable heart stents offer structural integrity during the healing process, with metals that eventually degrade, further contributing to vascular restoration. Both types aim to reduce long-term complications associated with traditional permanent stents, improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
