<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organ Preservation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Cold Storage</li><li>Hypothermic Machine Perfusion</li><li>Normothermic Machine Perfusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organ preservation market encompasses three key types: Static Cold Storage, Hypothermic Machine Perfusion, and Normothermic Machine Perfusion. Static Cold Storage involves storing organs at low temperatures, minimizing metabolic activity. Hypothermic Machine Perfusion enhances preservation by actively circulating a cold preservation solution through the organ, improving nutrient delivery and maintaining viability. Normothermic Machine Perfusion keeps organs at near-body temperature, offering continuous metabolic activity support, which helps better assess organ function before transplantation, ultimately improving transplant outcomes.</p></p>
