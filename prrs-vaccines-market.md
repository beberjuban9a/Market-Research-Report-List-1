<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PRRS Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PRRS vaccines market is primarily categorized into live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines use attenuated strains of the virus, providing strong immunity and often a longer-lasting effect, but may carry a risk of reversion to virulence. Killed vaccines, on the other hand, utilize inactivated virus, offering a safer alternative with no risk of disease but generally require multiple doses to achieve effective immunity. Each type plays a critical role in controlling Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome in swine populations.</p></p>
